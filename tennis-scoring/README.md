Tennis Scoring Kata
============


# Introduction #

In a game of tennis, a player begins with a score of zero (0). With each success, the player earns more points. The points are earned in this sequence:

* 0
* 15
* 30
* 40


If a player has 40 and scores again, that player wins the game as long as the other player does not also have _40_ points. If both players reach _40_ points it is referred to as a **deuce**.

Scoring during deuce give a player advantage. If the other player scores again, the score returns to deuce. If a player has advantage and scores again, that player wins the game.
