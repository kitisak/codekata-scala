Roman Numerals problem
==============

Roman numerals, the numeric system used in ancient Rome, employs combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet to signify values. The numbers 1 to 10 can be expressed in Roman numerals as follows:
I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X.
The Roman numeral system is a cousin of Etruscan numerals. Use of Roman numerals continued after the decline of the Roman Empire. From the 14th century on, Roman numerals began to be replaced in most contexts by more convenient Hindu-Arabic numerals; however this process was gradual, and the use of Roman numerals in some minor applications continues to this day.


Roman Numerals, as used today, are based on seven symbols:

| Symbol	| Value |
| --- | --- |
| I	        | 1     |
| V	        | 5     |
| X	        | 10    |
| L	        | 50    |
| C	        | 100   |
| D	        | 500   |
| M	        | 1000  |
